## Summary and Reflection

For the Flutter profile page, I implemented a structured data model (UserInfo) to streamline user details, enhancing code clarity and maintainability. I used SingleChildScrollView for better content accessibility on smaller screens and incorporated ExpansionTile for a collapsible work experience section. However, I faced challenges with the grid layout for project images, struggling to maintain responsiveness, and couldn't fully implement dynamic loading for additional project details.

I enjoyed designing the UI and exploring Flutterâ€™s widgets, but found the grid layout challenging. More familiarity with Flutter's layout mechanics would have been beneficial. Overall, this project was a great learning experience that improved my skills in the UI design.
